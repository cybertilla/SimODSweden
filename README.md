# SIMOD_SWE

A model for assessing the impact of policy change in organ donation systems; case study: Sweden.

## AGENTS
* Patients: here called donors since only patients who die are considered in the model.
Donors have different states, describing them with respect to organ donation.
    * States are: possible, potential, elegible, actual, and deceased without donation (no-donation).

* STAFF: Hospital staff responsible for donation procedures.
They are tasked with discovering potential donors, contacting the TCs when death is inevitable and guiding the donation process.

* TC: Transplant Coordinators. They coordinate the process from donation (ICU) to transplantation (Transplant Hospitals) according to supply and demand. They are responsible for:
    * contacting Transplant Surgeons (not modeled), who establish the medical viability and
    * investigating consent via the registry and families of the deceased (Potential Donors).

* Patches: ICUs, Intensive Care Units, generated via the map and according to the number of public ICU in the country.

## SLIDERS AND INTERFACE

* Population
    * total_population: the total population of the country
    * bd_rate: the rate of brain death, obtained via ICD-10 codes explaining actual donor diagnosis

* Infrastructure
    * Staff: the amount of specialised Organ Donation Staff which is distributed across ICUs
    * n-icus: the amount of ICUs active in the country

* Interventions
  * Best Practice TC: sets the average TC contact rate from the national average (2015-2023) to the local best performers.
  * Best Practices Donation: sets the average Medical Viability and Consent rate from the national average (2015-2023) to the local best performer hospitals.

* Policy
  * Current Policy: sets all inputs to 2023's values.
  * ICOD: simulates donor pool expansion.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

The plot of yearly pmp and its reaction to slider value changes.

The Donor state plot gives insight into the effect of policies and interventions on the functioning of the donation system as a whole.

## THINGS TO TRY

Modify the value of Staff, hit Setup and run the simulation, compare Donor States to previous runs.

What is the best combination of policies to maximise yearly pmp?

What if we want to maximise Actual Donor pmp and minimize the amount of other Donor States throughout the process?

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

This model can be expanded with more agents e.g. ORGAN TYPES, DONOR DEMOGRAPHICS, POPULATION CHANGES etc.

E.g. Add a step function for the make-donor-pool procedure.

E.g. Calculate TC workload by counting links.

E.g. Run the simulations with Behaviour Space and vary the population size of the country.

Age implementation is relatively easy, add an AGE attribute to the Donor agent and assign its value based on empirical distributions.

## NETLOGO FEATURES

The environment is created by reading the map.png file, patches are processed according to their color.

TC coordinates are fixed.

The function _random-poisson_ is used to simulate fluctuations in donor pool.
